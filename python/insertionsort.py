"""Insertion Sort: simple sorting algorithm.

Insertion sort has a worst case and average performance of O(nÂ²). Insertion
sort is a stable sort, meaning it preserves the order of equal elements and
it sorts the given list in place.

Algorithm steps:
 - iterate over each element in list, creating a sorted sub list behind
 - start at index 1, as one element sublist at index 0 is already sorted
 - at each iteration, copy out the element at the current (outer) index
 - loop backwards over the sub list, moving greater items to the right,
   until you find an element less than the current item
 - insert the current element into the space created

        current_value = a_list[idx]
